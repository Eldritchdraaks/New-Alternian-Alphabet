    description: "The Alternian alphabet used in the comic is a modified version of Daedric alphabet from <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>. When <i>Hiveswap</i> was in production, the team made a new original alphabet that became the new canon for Alternia. This mod replaces the old alphabet with the new. Additionally, it now reads left to right, which is also now canon.",
